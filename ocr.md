## Welcome

Welcome to the North American Patristics Society workshop on optical character recognition (OCR), which allows you to extract text from an image. In this workshop we will explore how you can use OCR to build a corpus of texts for your research. Focusing on printed sources, primarily in English, secondarily with another language important for early Christian Studies (Greek, Latin, Syriac, and Coptic), we will survey some OCR applications that are available, and then demonstrate actual work through Tesseract.

During the live hands-on session, we will gather as a group, and help one another to debug our processes, and optimize our workflow. We will also discuss
